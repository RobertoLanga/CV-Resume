  <h3>Means of establishing contact</h3>
  <p>In the mornings I can usually be found jogging in the parks of Bucharest. Evenings in the kitchen, most likely checking the oven after forgeting about it for a while.</p>
  <p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:langa.roberto@gmail.com">langa.roberto@gmail.com</a></p>
  <p>Telephone: <a href="not today gif.gif">+40.73*.***.***</a></p>
  <p>Mail delivered by ravens or owls accepted as well. This method is actually the most endorsed one.
    The letter that I was suposed to receive by owl when I was 11 years old never arrived so I'm looking forward to experiencing this.</p>
